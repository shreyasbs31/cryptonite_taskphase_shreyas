# Comprehending Commands

## Challenge 1: cat: not the pet, but the command!
cat command basically reads the file, and i know that the flag was written in the flag file so i read that file. 
```
pwn.college{M4XRyRJ_2Ovy9Fki5mWun9t-Cv0.dFzN1QDLzkDO0czW}
```

## Challenge 2: catting absolute paths
i read the file from the /flag directory.
```
pwn.college{owZsziIF0YY4eka49bZAMEFMhIw.dlTM5QDLzkDO0czW}
```

## Challenge 3: more catting practice

```
pwn.college{45N-py4sSuEU2at_iXVbmbZtugH.dBjM5QDLzkDO0czW}
```
##

## Challenge 4: grepping for a needle in a haystack
i know the flag starts with pwn.college so i can use the grep command to read through the list of text and easily find the flag
```
pwn.college{YIYHIIB49r6Vvok_Rf1jbvvVZRk.ddTM4QDLzkDO0czW}
```

## Challenge 5: listing files
learnt how to use ls command and run was renamed so i listed the file to see what it was and ran it.

## Challenge 9: An Epic Filesystem Quest
it was a really fun dive into a bunch of directories, and i gained full control over cd cat and ls commands.

## Challenge 11: finding files
i used find to search through the entire home directory for the word flag, and then individually checked every file to see which had the flag.
```
pwn.college{4Gsn8l8tDVTZIbrWP9kwxv6Q-jf.dJzM4QDLzkDO0czW}
```
##

## Challenge 12: linking files
i first used the rm function to remove any files in the /home/hacker/not-the-flag directory, and then i linked it to /flag . After that i used cat /challenge/catflag to read the /home/hacker/not-the-flag
```
pwn.college{Ezn6PNzNlKmTquQGayvw-V2Nvkw.dlTM1UDLzkDO0czW}
