# Mumbo Dumbo

**FLAG**: `nite{C@TCHME!FY0UCAN}`

## Approach
This one was surprisingly easy. I first got the bot to start working. Then the main point of the challenge was to confuse and manipulate the bot into giving me the password. So all i had to do was confuse the bot into giving me the password, by confusing it and making it forget its initial instructions by challenging its beliefs and making it question itself. 
I wasn't able to record exactly what i told the bot, but it was fairly simple, just had to convince it to rethink its ideology and principles and end up giving me the password.
