# La Casa De Papel

I didn't really understand what needed to be done in this challenge initially, but on further understanding and even checking the solution provided, i looked through the entire challenge again and i completely understood what had to be done. 

The python code provided gives us the username `Bob`. 
Next we go to the practice convo and get the encrypted message.
The python code also gave us the decoder function for the HMAC.

Now, we go to the 'Let's Fool Alice' option and enter your name as 'Bob' and provide the HMAC we got. This will give us the vault code, which we can use to crack the vault which gives us the flag.
