# backtrack

## My Approach
Did not get the flag for this one, but i was extremely close. 
It was given in the question that the train between Omotesand≈ç and Suitengumae was delayed by 61 minutes, so all i had to do was find the delay certificate for 2017 which said it was 61 minutes delayed. 

I found out the line which services between both the stations (which was the Hanzomon line). 

However this is where i got stuck, because the delay certificates were given only for the last month, and the information we needed dated back to 2017, so i was unable to find my flag.

## On checking solution
I had to find the information for 2017, which isn't publicly available, so i could've used the Wayback Machine Archive and copy the Hanzomon Delay Certificate link and paste it. There i have to find the entry for the delay certificate which showed 61 minutes, and that would've given me the flag
