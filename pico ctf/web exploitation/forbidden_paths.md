# Forbidden Paths

**FLAG**: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}`

## Approach
This was a rather simple challenge as it was completely based on underestanding file paths. It was mentioned that the webpage could only read relative file paths. 
It was also mentioned that the flag exists in the `/usr/share/nginx/html/` directory. So we wrote a relative path for the `/flag.txt` by doing `../../../../flag.txt`. This directly gave us the flag.
