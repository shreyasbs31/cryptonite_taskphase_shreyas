# C3

**FLAG**: `picoCTF{adlibs}`

## Approach
I tried to reverse the algorithm in the encoder (convert.py) by changing the string. Took the variables from lookup2 changed cur-prev to cur+prev so that I add the value that was initially subtracted ig (basically reversing what was to be done) and changed the value of prev from cur to (cur+prev)%40.

So my first script was: 
`
import sys

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

x = ""
prev = 0
for char in chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    y = (cur + prev) % 40
    x += lookup1[y]
    prev = y

print(x)
`
Then i ran the script received in output, provided the script itself as input and received my flag.

`
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == (b * b * b):
        print(chars[i], end="")
        b += 1

print()
`

## Wrong Approaches
I wrote the wrong code the first time and had to use chatgpt to correct my errors. Then i accidentally provided the wrong input to the programs.
