# Cookies

**FLAG**: `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}`

## Approach
Initially i checked random inputs to see if it did anything. It kept showing me error at first, and then i typed `snickerdoodle` it said "That is a cookie! Not very special though..."
That's when i understood that its related to cookies, so i inspected the webpage and went to application tab and went to cookies.
Then i noticed that the cookie `name` kept changing values on entering "snickerdoodle" so i thought you have to keep changing the cookie value till i get some valid answer.
So i kept changing the value of the cookie constantly and refreshing the page. I kept doing this from the beginning ie `1` till i reached `18`, as on 18 when i refreshed the page, the flag showed up on the screen.

## Wrong Approaches
I tried to input random random values, and other than that i also randomly typed various cookie names to see if it worked. I also at one point tried to create my own cookies and setting its value to see if it made any difference.
I also tried using the name of the cookie as input for a while.
